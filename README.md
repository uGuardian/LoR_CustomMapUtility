# LoR_CustomMapUtility

Use by requiring ConfigAPI and referencing the DLL for auto updates, or by dropping the cs files in Assembly into your own project and add using CustomMapUtility to your namespace references.

Documentation is in-progress, basic usage is detailed in Template.cs
The Resources folder is included in your own mod, rename Template to your map name and include whichever image files you need. Only Background and Floor are required.

Can be used as a psuedo sound file loader, proper as one coming soon.
